# Bechdel-Score-Test

Data analysis of gender disparity in Hollywood

The Data Question: My aim was to collect data from various different sources, and answer the following questions about the Bechdel test:

    Have the Bechdel scores of movies improved over the years?
    Do movies with higher IMDB ratings have higher Bechdel scores?
    Do movies with female directors have higher Bechdel scores?
    Does the budget of a movie have any impact on its Bechdel score?
    Do movies with higher Bechdel scores generate a larger revenue?
